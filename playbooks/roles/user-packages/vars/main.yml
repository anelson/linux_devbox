  # neovim is built with Python 2.7, but it seems the ensime vim plugin
  # uses the 'pip' command to test for packages, so to avoid an annoying
  # error message (and in anticipation of someday neovim using python 3)
  # install the packages in Python 3.x also
  - sexpdata # for ensime vim
  - websocket-client # also for ensime vim
  - neovim # also for ensime vim
